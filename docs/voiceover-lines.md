# KVEC Triage — Voiceover Lines

KVEC Triage is a mobile app that uses MedGemma to solve one of the biggest problems in emergency medicine — documentation. Every EMS call requires a Patient Care Report, and paramedics spend 20 to 40 minutes writing each one, usually hours after the call from memory. KVEC Triage lets them enter brief clinical notes at the point of care and get a complete, structured report in seconds — entirely on-device, entirely offline.

Here's how it works. The provider opens the app and types their clinical notes — just quick shorthand, the way they'd speak during a radio report to the hospital.

These are rough, unstructured notes — abbreviations, shorthand, the way providers actually talk. Now tap Generate PCR.

MedGemma takes those notes and generates a structured Patient Care Report in real time. You can see the sections streaming in — Chief Complaint, HPI, Vitals, Physical Exam, Assessment, Interventions, and Disposition. These follow NHTSA and NEMSIS documentation standards. MedGemma uses correct EMS abbreviations, organizes findings into the right sections, and never fabricates information that wasn't in the original notes.

That entire report generated in about 20 seconds. What would normally take 30 minutes of typing is done before the provider even arrives at the hospital.

But KVEC Triage goes beyond documentation. Once the PCR is generated, the provider can request a clinical decision support assessment. MedGemma analyzes the report and produces an ESI acuity level — that's the standard 1 through 5 emergency severity scale — along with differential diagnoses, recommended interventions, and a transport priority with facility type.

This acts as a cognitive aid — a second set of eyes that can catch things under pressure. It supports the provider's judgment without replacing it.

KVEC Triage also includes a multimodal medical chat powered by MedGemma's vision capabilities.

There are four quick-assess modes for common field scenarios. For example, a provider can photograph a wound and MedGemma will classify it, estimate severity, and suggest field treatment.

They can also photograph medications for identification, skin conditions for differential suggestions, or ECG strips for rhythm analysis. All of this runs locally through MedGemma's vision projector — no images are ever uploaded anywhere.

All generated reports are saved locally and searchable. Providers can review past PCRs with their triage assessments, copy them to their ePCR system, or delete them.

And critically — everything stays on the phone. There are no cloud calls, no analytics, no data transmission of any kind. Patient data never leaves the device. This is HIPAA compliance by architecture, not by policy.

KVEC Triage turns MedGemma into a field-ready clinical tool — generating structured documentation, providing decision support, and analyzing medical images, all running on a phone with no internet required. For the 40 million EMS transports that happen every year in the US, this could save thousands of hours of documentation time and improve the quality of every patient handoff. Thank you.
